# Caesar Cipher Encryption (Python)

This project is a basic Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** encryption technique.
It encrypts text by shifting each alphabetical character forward by a fixed number of positions,
while preserving letter case and leaving non-alphabet characters unchanged.
